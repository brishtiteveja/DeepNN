The
electronics
,
automotive
and
aerospace
concern
said
third-quarter
net
was
$
60
million
,
or
98
cents

,
down
from

68

Projected

A
report
last
month
by
the
Interstate
Natural
Gas
Association
of
America
found
that
pipelines
'
settlement
costs
had
jumped
in
the
three
months
before
the
deadline
to
39
cents
on
the
dollar
,
from
22
cents
on
the
dollar
in
1988
.

The
takeover-stock
traders
were
hoping
that
Mr.
Davis
or
one
of
the
other
interested
parties
might
re-emerge
with
the
situation
in
disarray
,
or
that
the
board
might
consider
a
recapitalization
.

Though
the
agency
could
remove
Mr.
Paul
,
it
has
no
current
intention
to
do
that
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Honeywell
reported
earnings
of
$
212.1
million
,
or
$
4.92
a
share
,
compared
with
earnings
of
$
47.9
million
,
or
$
1.13
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Honeywell
said
it
is
negotiating
the
sale
of
a
second
stake
in
Yamatake-Honeywell
,
but
indicated
it
intends
to
hold
at
least
20
%
of
the
joint
venture
's
stock
long
term
.

It
was
the
second
time
in
less
than
a
week
that
Quotron
has
had
problems
calculating
the
industrial
average
.

Los
Angeles
financier
Marvin
Davis
,
who
put
United
in
play
with
a
$
5.4
billion
bid
two
months
ago
,
last
night
proffered
both
a
ray
of
hope
and
an
extra
element
of
uncertainty
by
saying
he
remains
interested
in
acquiring
UAL
.

Still
,
most
retailing
observers
expect
that
all
the
proposed
retailing
LBOs
will
depend
partly
on
the
sale
of
junk
bonds
,
a
market
already
in
tumult
,
in
part
because
of
concerns
associated
with
bonds
issued
by
the
Federated
and
Allied
units
of
Campeau
.

To
help
do
this
,
Mr.
Palmer
developed
a
portable
massage
chair
three
years
ago
that
he
hopes
will
bring
``
structured
touching
''
into
mainstream
America
.

In
addition
,
IBM
's
growth
in
software
in
the
third
quarter
was
just
8.8
%
,
well
below
historical
levels
even
when
adjusted
to
reflect
last
year
's
payment
from
Fujitsu
and
the
stronger
dollar
.

The
metal
products
concern
currently
has
7.2
million
common
shares
outstanding
.

Occasionally
,
all
that
's
needed
is
a
little
coaxing
.

``
In
my
view
,
{
massages
}
should
be
managed
with
an
appropriate
mixture
of
males
and
females
around
,
''
he
says
.

If
so
,
the
damages
could
be
tripled
.

The
collection
was
at
the
heart
of
a
grandiose
plan
Mr.
Paul
had
in
which
the
art
was
to
do
double
duty
--
as
an
investment
for
CenTrust
and
as
decoration
for
the
S&L
's
new
office
tower
,
designed
by
I.M.
Pei
.

Nothing
bravura
,
no
arpeggios
,
no
ticklish
fingering
problems
challenge
the
performer
.

But
at
just
that
moment
,
he
is
interrupted
in
his
office
by
a
servant
in
tuxedo
who
pours
coffee
from
silver
into
a
cup
of
china
and
dabs
the
brim
with
linen
.

The
once-staid
steel
industry
is
about
to
be
turned
topsy-turvy
by
a
1990s
technology
revolution
.

After
Friday
's
decline
,
Mr.
Perritt
's
firm
ran
statistical
tests
on
100
high-quality
stocks
,
using
old-fashioned
value
criteria
devised
by
Benjamin
Graham
,
an
analyst
and
author
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
who
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
father
of
modern
securities
analysis
.

There
,
amid
oil
paintings
and
marble
tables
,
massages
are
administered
every
Wednesday
.

With
great
aplomb
he
considers
not
only
filial
devotion
and
(
utterly
repressed
)
sexual
love
,
but
British
anti-Semitism
,
the
gentry
's
impatience
with
democracy
and
support
of
Hitler
,
and
the
moral
problematics
of
loyalty
:
``
It
is
,
in
practice
,
simply
not
possible
to
adopt
such
a
critical
attitude
towards
an
employer
and
at
the
same
time
provide
good
service
...
.

The
new
notes
will
bear
interest
at
5.5
%
through
July
31
,
1991
,
and
thereafter
at
10
%
.

The
stock
has
fallen
$
87.25
,
or
31
%
,
in
the
three
trading
days
since
announcement
of
the
collapse
of
the
$
300-a-share
takeover
jolted
the
entire
stock
market
into
its
second-worst
plunge
ever
.

Traders
are
likely
to
oppose
such
restrictions
because
dual
trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money
in
slower
markets
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
customer
orders
.

``
You

''
said
Mr.

.

Earlier
this
year
,
bankers
and
other
investors
were
willing
to
provide
financing
because
they
assumed
there
would
be
major
gains
in
both
profitability
and
sales
,
Mr.
Rosenthal
added
.

Not
only
is
the
typical
Glasswork

it
is
also

But
unfortunately
,
that
segment
is
much
smaller
than
the

.

With

corporate
profits
on
the
horizon
for

say

go
on
being
cheap
for
a
long
time
.

5.81
billion
,
or
$
9.80
a
share
,
which
itself
was
well
below
the
record
IBM
set
in
1984
.

AMR
had
also
sought
to
foil
Mr.
Trump
in
Congress
by
lobbying
for
legislation
that
would
have
bolstered
the
authority
of
the
Transportation
Department
to
reject
airline
buy-outs
.

Far
from
being
minimalist
,
the
music
unabatingly
torments
us
with
apparent
novelties
not
so
cleverly
disguised
in
the
simplicities
of
4\/4
time
,
octave
intervals
,
and
ragtime
or
gospel
chord
progressions
.

But
at
a
meeting
last
week
,
Tom
Donovan
,
the
Board
of
Trade
's
president
,
told
commodity
lawyers
:
``
Dual
trading
is
definitely
worth
saving
.

Jonathan
H.
Kress
,
the
son
of
the
painting
's
former
owner
,
Mrs.
Rush
Kress
,
dismisses
the
price
talk
as
``
sour
grapes
.
''

While
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
FBI
charges
,
dual
trading
became
a
focus
of
attempts
to
tighten
industry
regulations
.

Even
if
the
buy-out
group
is
able
to
obtain
financing
,
the
transaction
still
faces
obstacles
.

In
addition
,
the
coalition
of
labor
and
management
,
longtime
enemies
who
joined
forces
only
under
the
threat
of
Mr.
Davis
's
bid
,
could
break
apart
now
.

What
with
Halloween
coming
and
bigger
defense
cuts
looming
,
more
and
more
Pentagon
bureaucrats
are
crawling
under
their
desks
.

Partly
because
the
1987
market
crash
made
it
harder
for
them
to
find
financing
,
many
high-technology
concerns
have
made
such
alliances
recently
.

Making
matters
worse
was
the
fact
that
late
Friday
afternoon
the
CBOE
halted
stock-index
options
trading
in
step
with
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
's
halt
in
stock-index
futures
.

Even
giant
Samsung
Group
is
rumored
in
the
Korean
press
to
be
considering
getting
into
the
auto-making
business
;
a
company
spokesman
had
no
comment
.

CBOE
Chairman
Alger
``
Duke
''
Chapman
,
said
that
,
unlike
the
futures
market
,
the
options
exchange
has
to
open
in
a
rotation
that
allows
each
different
options
series
to
trade
.

But
it
's
hard
to
squeeze
much
profit
out
of
the
personal-computer
business
these
days
,
and
the
workstation
market
,
while
important
,
is
too
small
to
rely
on
for
much
growth
.

Fosset
so
far
is
the
only
member
of
a
financial
exchange
to
be
forced
to
be
taken
over
by
another
firm
as
a
result
of
Friday
's
rout
.

After
two
years
of
drought
,
it
rained
money
in
the
stock-index
futures
markets
yesterday
.

It
's
a
recognition
that
there
was
much
too
much
fluff
in
the
LBO
market
.

In
1941
,
Raeder
and
the
German
navy
threatened
to
attack
the
Panama
Canal
,
so
we
created
the
Southern
Command
in
Panama
.

In
what
is
believed
to
be
the
first
cancellation
of
a
loan
to
China
since
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
,
an
international
bank
syndicate
has
terminated
a
$
55
million
credit
for
a
Shanghai
property
project
.

But
the
basic
technology
in
the
line
is
almost
five
years
old
,
which
means
it
is
long
in
the
tooth
,
and
competitors
are
rolling
out
strong
products
of
their
own
.

The

been
working
together
since

long
before

``
At

the

The

did
n't
cite
specific
situations
where
dual
trading
might
be
allowed
,
but
smaller
exchanges

contracts
that
need
additional
liquidity
are
expected
to
be
among
them
.

But
this
year
,
when
the
hullabaloo
surrounding
its
centennial
died
,
so
too
did
some
advertiser
interest
.

He
bought
$
4
billion

is
expanding

''
said
Kathryn
McGrath
,
head
of
the
investment
management
division
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

Individual
investors
face
high
transaction
costs
of
moving
in
and
out
of
the
market
.

The
main
issues
remaining
are
how
to
calculate
damages
and
whether
the
infringement
was
``
willful

deliberate

The
state
gave
CenTrust
30
days

Berlitz
will

THE

says

Unlike
the
week
following
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
,
individual
traders
in
the
S&P
500
pit
were
also
being
uncharacteristically
circumspect
about
their
one-day
profits
.

``
In
the
year
2000
it
will

Observers
said
it
appeared
that
British
Air
was
angered
at
the
way
the
bid
has
degenerated
into
confusion
,
as
well
as
by
the
banks
'
effort
to
round
up
financing
for
what
one
called
``
a
deal
that
is
n't
a
deal
.
''

Meanwhile
,
in
another
sign
that
a
new
bid
is
n't
imminent
,
it
was
learned
that
the
UAL
board
held
a
telephone
meeting
Monday
to
hear
an
update
on
the
situation
,
but
that
a
formal
board
meeting
is
n't
likely
to
be
convened
until
early
next
week
.

Producers
also
are
trying
to
differentiate
by
concentrating
on
higher-profit
output
,
such
as
coated
and
electrogalvanized
products
,
which
remain
beyond
the
reach
of
minimills
.

The
price
paid
was
a
record
for
the
artist
.

Last
year
,
the
research
and
development
division
of
Weyerhaeuser
Co.
,
the
large
wood-products
concern
,
invited
a

to
its
Tacoma

Wash.

offices
.

But
the
Makro
chain
,
which
operates
as
a
joint
venture
between
K
mart
and
SHV
Holdings
N.V.
of
the
Netherlands
,
has
only
six
stores
and
annual
sales
that
one
analyst
estimated
at
about
$
300
million
.

The
Clean
Water

no

When
the
loan
agreement
was
announced
,
it
was
hailed
as
one
of
the
first
Western-style
financing
transactions
ever
used
in
China
.

Hydro-Quebec
said
Maine
regulators
'
refusal
to
approve
the

earlier
this

the

decides

,

familiar

said
the
fact
that
seven

The
latest
round
of
losses
is
likely
to
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
which
has
never
fully
recovered
from
the
aftershock
of
Black
Monday
,
when
investors
fled
the
market
because
of
huge
losses

experienced
improved

He
explains

``
With

here
,
bragging

said
one
trader
,
referring
to
the
federal

far
has
resulted

The

``
The

market
ai
n't
going

much
of
anything

for
a
while

of

Paintings
are
just
part
of
the
picture

Raw-steel
production
by
the
nation
's
mills
decreased
0.8
%
last
week
to
1,828,000
tons
from
1,843,000
tons
the
previous
week
,
the
American
Iron
and
Steel
Institute
said
.

Unlike
most
loans
to
China
,
there
was
no
Chinese
guarantor
.

Mr.
Paul
thus
developed
a
close
,
symbiotic
relationship
with
Sotheby
's
.

The
effort
to
revive
the
bid
was
complicated
by
the
unwieldy
nature
of
the
three-party
buying
group
.

In
the
late
1960s
some
CPAs
failed
to
correct
such
abuses
as
clients
picking
permissive
rules
that
hyped
earnings
and
stock
prices
.

Now
,
callers
are
led
through
complex
menus
of
choices
to
retrieve
information
they
want
,
and
the
hardware
can
process
10,000

Donald
Trump
,
who
faced
rising
doubt
about
his
bid
for
American
Airlines
parent
AMR
Corp.
even
before
a
United
Airlines
buy-out
came
apart
Friday
,
withdrew
his
$
7.54
billion
offer
.

In
January
,
the
Preti
painting
that
now
hangs
at
CenTrust
was
expected
to
bring
no
more
than
$
700,000
at
auction
until
Mr.
Paul
came
along
with
his
$
1.15
million
.

After
sitting
with
20
%
of
his
fund
in
cash
before
Friday
's
sell-off
,
Mr.
Neff
says
he
bought
``
a
narrow
list
of
stocks
''
yesterday
.

And
rumors
of
forced
selling
by
takeover-stock
traders
triggered
a
25-point
downdraft
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
around
11:15
a.m.
EDT
yesterday
.

``
It
's
called
bad
money
driving
out
good
money
,
''
said
one
retailing
observer
.

Either
one
likes
it
or
one
does
n't
.

``
We
are
very
lucky
to
easily
change
an
export
loss
to
domestic
plus
,
''
says
Hong
Tu
Pyo
,
managing
director
of
domestic
marketing
for
Hyundai
Motor
Co
.

The
11
banks
in
the
syndicate
sustained
no
monetary
losses
because
none
of
the
credit
facility
had
been
drawn
down
.

John
Stoner
,
marketing
director
for
True
Temper
Corp.
,
a
subsidiary
of
Black
&
Decker
,
says
people
do
n't
want
to
move
a
leaf
pile
.

But
CBOE
and
Amex
officials
said
that
Options
Clearing
Corp.
contributed
$
20
million
to
the
guarantee
,
the
CBOE
put
up
$
8
million
,
the
Amex
added
$
4
million
and
$
18
million
came
from
Mr.
Fossett
's
own
assets
.

But
while
making
the
obvious
point
that
both
composers
develop
variations
from
themes
,
this
comparison
ignores
the
intensely
claustrophobic
nature
of
Mr.
Glass
's
music
.

The
CFTC
said
it
will
propose
the
restrictions
after
the
release
of
a
study
that
shows
little
economic
benefit
resulting
from
dual
trading
and
cites
``
problems
''
associated
with
the
practice
.

Kia
is
reportedly
also
considering
such
a
plan
.

But
funds
generally
are
better
prepared
this
time
around
.

William
O'Donnell
,
president
,
says
he
still
thinks
the
IPO
will
succeed
.

The
company
had
losses
for
several
years
before
turning
profitable
in
fiscal
1988
.

From
the
fee
,
the
local
phone
company
and
the
long-distance
carrier
extract
their
costs
to
carry
the
call
,
passing
the
rest
of
the
money
to
the
originator
,
which
must
cover
advertising
and
other
costs
.

The
Swedish
publishing
company
Bonniers
owns
51
%
of
Are
Paev

and
the
Estonian

company
Minor
owns
49

The

Shareholders
have
been
steadily
bailing
out
of
several
big
junk
funds
the
past
several
weeks
as
the
$
200
billion
market
was
jolted
by
a
cash
crunch
at
Campeau
Corp.
and
steadily
declining
prices
.

Quotron
Systems
Inc.
,
a
Citicorp
unit
,
blamed
the
30-minute
foul-up
on
``
a
timing
problem
in
our
software
''
caused
by
the
enormous
early
volume
--
about
145
million
shares
in
the
first
hour
of
New

Stock
Exchange
trading

Lewis
H.
Eslinger
,
Sony

said
he
doubts

will
go
ahead
with
a

He
wants
to
see
steelmakers
more
involved
in
computers
and
artificial
intelligence
.

``
One
of
the
hardest
things
to
do
is
to
buy
stocks
when
the
market
is
down
,
''
he
says
.

Eighteen

``
I

wear
a
little

Ms.

who
has
been
visiting

since
January
.

People
were
interested
in
seeing
him
,
but
it
was
recognized
that
the
route
was
through
Sotheby

and
particularly
George
Wachter
.

Some
takeover
stock
traders
had
been
betting
against
Mr.
Trump
because
he
has
a
record
of
disclosing
stakes
in
companies
that
are
potential
takeover
targets
,
then
selling
at
a
profit
without
making
a
bid
.

Honeywell
Inc.
said
it
hopes
to
complete
shortly
the
first
of
two
sales
of
shares
in
its
Japanese
joint
venture
,
Yamatake-Honeywell
,
for
about
$
280

The

of

depending
on
when
the

exercises
its

At

the
execution
of

Alan
Wells
,
president
of
Bollinger
,
Wells
,
Lett
&
Co.
,
a
New
York
merger
specialist
,
thinks
panicky
investors
may
lose
their
enthusiasm
for
leveraged
buy-out
and
giant
takeover
deals
.

Sitting
in
one
of
Mr.
Palmer
's
chairs
,
which
cost
$
425
and
have
since
been
copied
by
others
,
is
a
bit
like
straddling
a
recliner
.

Led
by
Pizza
Hut
and
Taco
Bell
,
restaurant
earnings
increased
about
25
%
in
the
third
quarter
on
a
22
%
sales
increase
.

To
keep
him
quiet
we
invent
a
new
unified
command
every
year
or
so
run
by
the
Army
or
the
Air
Force
and
put
more
of
the
Navy

Marines
under
it
.

It
has
a
similar
project
for
200,000
cars
a

.

In
the
past
five
years
,
more
than
68
%
of
its

have
been

All
these
reports
about
him
committing
genocide
are
probably
exaggerated
anyway
.

Many
fund
managers
have
boosted
their
cash
levels
in
recent
weeks
.

Yesterday
's

was
led
by
RJR

13
3\/4

bonds

which
initially
tumbled
three
points
,

30
for

amount
,
to
96
1\/4

rebounding
to
99
3\/4
.

A
majority
of
old
contracts
were
renegotiated
by
the
deadline
and
settled
at
steep
discounts
.

European
dealers
continued
to
dominate
the
action
in
old
masters
,
which
Sotheby
's
North
America
had
lately
been
touting
in
this
country
.

(
Impressionist

modern
paintings
,
not
tracked
by
Salomon
,
are
ranked

higher

)

But
the
magazine
was
slower
than
its
competitors
to
come
up
with
its
regional
editions
,
and
until
last
year
offered
fewer
of
them
than
did
competitors

It
is
n't
that
major
steelmakers

blithely
ignored
high

``

It
largely
rested

hard-to-fault
demographics
:
10.8
million

half

up
from
10.5
million
a
year
ago
;
an
average
age
of

for
readers
--
at
the
height
of
their
consuming
years
;
loyalty
to
the
tune
of
an
85

average
subscription
renewal
rate
.

Integrated
said
that
it
would
continue
to
pursue
``
other
alternatives
''
to
sell
the
five
core

that
a

plans

three
of

Integrated
Resources
Equity
Corp.
,
Resources
Trust
Co.
and
Integrated

Ms.
McGlade
of
PaineWebber
raised
a
more
fundamental
question
about
the
deal
.

Officials
at
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
processes
all
options
trades
for
U.S.
exchanges
,
said
that
the
$
50
million
guarantee
was
unprecedented
,
but
was
necessary
to
help
insure
the
integrity
of
the
options
markets
.

``
I
never
agreed
to
it
,
''
Mr.
Alexander
says
,
adding
that
``
it
's
not
necessary
to
pay
these
nuisance
settlements
.
''

Lee
Seidman
of
Cleveland
says
Infiniti
``
was
a
bear
on
interiors
''
but
at
least
let
him
retrofit
an
existing
building
--
without
the
stream
.

Parts
1
,
2
,
and
5
come
from
the
soundtrack
of
Errol
Morris
's
acclaimed
film
,
``
The
Thin
Blue
Line
,
''
and
the
two
other
parts
from
incidental
music
to
two
separate
dramatizations
of
the
Kafka
story
of
the
same
name
.

Citibank
and
Chase
had
agreed
to
commit
$
3
billion
,
and
said
they
were
``
highly
confident
''
of
raising
another
$
4.2
billion
.

Other
long-distance
carriers
have
also
begun
marketing
enhanced
900
service
,
and
special
consultants
are
springing
up
to
exploit
the
new
tool
.

And
any
strong
surge
in
redemptions
could
force
some
funds
to
dump
stocks
to
raise
cash
,
as
some
did
during
Black
Monday
.

Have
the
freedoms
of

gone
to
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
head
?

Japanese
and
European
steelmakers
,
which
have
led
the
recent
technology
developments
,
are
anxiously
awaiting
the
lifting
of
trade
restraints
in
1992

He
would

told
him

Mr.

left
an
indelible

world
--
and
not
for
the
better
.

Also
,
James
Needham
,
an
SEC
commissioner
,
in
April
1972
had
warned
that
the
industry
might
face
a
``
federal
agency
writing
accounting
rules
''
if
they
rejected
the
FASB
idea
.

As
a
result
,
Ireland
did
n't
spurn
the
Soviets
after
they
shot
down
a
Korean
Air
Lines
jetliner
over
the
Sea
of
Japan
in
1983
,
though
it
suspended
direct
Moscow-Shannon
flights
for
two
months

the

Whether

done
on

Alex

the

expressed
puzzlement
that

in

They
say
that
's
especially
important
this
late

when
there
's
no

we
still

accompanies
the
seemingly
endless
litany
of
reports
,
interviews

confessions
of
witnesses
in
the
Morris
film
.

It
all
started
with
geography
.

By
midnight
Oct.
6
,
all
of
the
paintings
were
supposed
to
have
been
sold
off
,
under
orders
from
Florida
's
comptroller

whose

regulates
the
state
's
S&Ls

So
what
's
the
best
way
to
buy
stocks
?

PRODUCTS
DON'T
have
to
be
first
to
be

``
If

Managers
at
five
chains
have
said
in
recent
weeks
that
they
intend
to
bid
for
their
companies
.

The
chains
include
Bloomingdale
's
,
owned
by
Campeau
Corp.
,
Toronto
;
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
and
Marshall
Field
's
,
owned
by
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
London
;
and
B.
Altman
&
Co.
and
Sakowitz
Inc.
,
owned
by
Hooker
Corp.
,
which
is
now
being
managed
by
a
court-appointed
provisional
liquidator
.

The
court
ordered
FERC
to
justify
within
60
days
not
only
its
cost-sharing
deadline
,
but
other
major
elements
of
its
proposed
regulation
for
introducing
more
competition
into
natural-gas
transportation
.

The

We
keep
a
lot
of
shrines
to
him
around
the
Pentagon
:
statues
,
busts
,
relics
and
such
.

There
are
some
important
caveats
:
Before
investing
in
stocks
,
individuals
should
have
at
least
three
to
six
months
of
living
expenses
set
aside
in
the
bank
,
most
investment
advisers
say
.

Together
,
Citicorp
and
Chase
received
$
8
million
in
fees
to
raise
the
rest
of
the
financing
.

A
week
later
,
the
man
told
Mr.
MacInnis
he
had
suffered
a
mild
heart
attack
unrelated
to
the
massage
.

But
if
the
board
rejects
a
reduced
bid
and
decides
to
explore
other
alternatives
,
it
could
transform
what
has
been
a
harmonious
process
into
an
adversarial
one
.

At
that
point
,
perhaps
diversification
would
be
appropriate
.

The
company

Dillon

as
its

The
airport

biggest
supplier
of
aircraft
fuel
is
the
Soviet
Union
.

That
's
the
lesson
offered
through
one
case
study
featured
in
a
design
exhibit
.

President
Bush
chose
Martin
Allday
,
a
longtime
friend
from
Texas
,
to
be
chairman
of
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
.

But
such
thin-slab
technology
is
only
the
beginning
.

Mr.
Gurria
,
Mexico
's
under-secretary
of
the
ministry
of
finance
,
met
yesterday
with
European
bankers
in
London
,
at
the
half-way
point
on
a
so-called
road
show
to
market
the
package
around
the
world
.

Certain
details
of
the
restructured
facilities
remain
to
be
negotiated
.

The
stock
closed
yesterday
at
$
103
a
share
,
up
just
$
1
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
as
the
market
surged
.

By
then
it
also
hopes
to
begin
producing
a
passenger
car
based
on
the
Volvo
240
and
selling
for
about
$
20,000
.

International
soft-drink

``

Its
advantage
has
been
the
peppy
little
Pride
,
sold
as
the
Ford
Festiva
in
the
U.S.
.

The
information
systems
segment
had
a
44
%
jump
sales
to
$
196
million
.

Then
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
ideas
would
n't
sound
like
so
much
blarney
.

Some
analysts
said
they
believed
Mr.
Trump
,
whose
towering
ego
had
been
viewed
by
some
as
a
reason
to
believe
he
would
n't
back
out
,
might
come
back
with
a
lower
bid
.

That
is
n't
all
.

He
met
Mr.
Bush
in
the
1950s
,
when
the
president
was
a
young
oil
man
in
Midland
and
Mr.
Allday
was
a
lawyer
for
an
oil
firm
.

Despite
the
number
of
fans
that
office
massage
has
won
,
some
purists
look
down
on
it
,
arguing
that
naked
,
full-body
rubs
are
the
only
way
to
go
.

Other
companies
figure
they
ca
n't
avoid
the
market
.

I
think
the
market
is
in
good
shape
.

At
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
the
leading
underwriter
of
junk
bonds
,
``
I
was
prepared
to
be
in
a
very
bad
mood
tonight
,
''
said
David
Feinman
,
a
junk
bond
trader
.

The
study
,
by
the
CFTC
's
division
of
economic
analysis
,
shows
that
``
a
trade
is
a
trade
,
''
a
member
of
the
study
team
said
.

They
're
very
friendly

For
a
while
,
high-cost
pornography
lines
and
services
that
tempt
children
to
dial
(
and
redial
)
movie
or
music
information
earned
the
service
a
somewhat
sleazy
image
,
but
new
legal
restrictions
are
aimed
at
trimming
excesses
.

The
success
of
newcomer
SsangYong

the
strength
of
the
auto
market
and
its
growing
diversity
.

Up
to
now
,

mainly
been
used
on

A

said
recent

changes
may
have
contributed
to
yesterday

A

invested
in

have
grown
to

use

,
the
auction
house
founded
in

1744
and
now
under
the
umbrella
of

was
hoping

The
combination
of
so
many
chains
available
for
sale
,
the
recent
failures
of
such
retailing
LBO
's
as
Miller
&
Rhoads
Inc.
and
declining
investor
confidence
will
drive
down
prices
,
retailing
observers
said
.

``
What
's
encouraging
about
this
is
that
retail
chains
will
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
their
sales
and

not
liquidation
values

Automotive

because

passenger
restraint
systems

TRW
said
.

People
also
should
n't
invest
money
in
stocks
that
they
'll
need
in
the
near
future
--
for
example
,
for
college
tuition
payments
or
retirement
expenses
.

The

Because
mutual
fund
trades
do
n't
take
effect
until
the
market
close
--
in
this
case
,
at
4
p.m.
--
these
shareholders
effectively
stayed
put
.

The
market
hovered
near
Friday
's
closing
price
of
328.85
for
about
a
half
hour
,
moving
several
index
points
higher
or
lower
in
seconds
,
then
broke
higher
and
did
n't
look
back
.

A
price
was

But
when

it

In
an
attempt
to
persuade
investors
that
his

was

just
``
a

Mr.

you

particularly
nerve-racking

South

are
expected
to
buy
almost
500,000
passenger
cars
this

up
60

The
comptroller

office
says
it
is
``

Also
,
at
any
of
Sotheby

,
roughly
one-third

collection
might
have
come
to
rival

the
Florida
comptroller

not
got

You

says
Mr.
Dennis

Its
supposedly
austere
minimalism
overlays
a
bombast
that
makes
one
yearn
for
the
astringency
of
neoclassical
Stravinsky
,
the
genuinely
radical
minimalism
of
Berg
and
Webern
,
and
what
in
retrospect
even
seems
like
concision
in
Mahler
.

The
main
reason
was
a
delay
in
shipment
of
new
high-end
disk
drives
,
a
business
that
accounts
for
some
10
%
of
IBM
's
$
60
billion
of
annual
revenue

Mr.
Paul
has
a
plan
to
bring
in
$
150
million
by
selling
off
63

CenTrust
's
71
branches
,
but
it
has
yet
to
be
approved
by
regulators
.

Proceeds
from
the
borrowings
under

credit
agreement
will
be
used
to
pay
an

dividend
to

and
to
lend
the
remainder
of
about
$
128
million
to
Maxwell
Communications
in
connection
with
a
promissory
note
.

fallen
sharply

high
of

It
is
as
though
the
land
knows
of
its
own
beauty
,
of
its
own
greatness
,
and
feels
no
need
to
shout
it

As
of
late
yesterday
,
the

still
on

will
be

More
than
400
traders
jammed
the

to
await

Some
think

The

But
as

Mr.

This
fatuous

not

be

Yesterday
's
88-point

from

Yesterday
's
rally
in
the
stock

markets
led
CBOE

officials
to
conclude
that

``

''
Mr.

concedes
,

he
says
those
who

have

some

contend
K

has
agreed

pay

much
for

Literally

Even
though
National

offers
far
more
readers

``

you

Robert

,
with

agrees
.

But
from
his
vantage
point
,
it
is
n't
that
Mr.

overpaid

have
said
they
are
looking

Moreover
,

contends
it

know

would
have
wished

''

Other
mutual
fund
companies
reported
even
lighter
withdrawal
requests
.

So
far
no
one
has
.

Not
only
could
the
Wall
Street
gyrations
damp
Christmas
sales
if
consumers
lose
confidence
in
the
economy
,
but
potential
junk-bond
buyers
are
sure
to
demand
even
stronger
covenants

greater

Bankers
believed
in
the
greater-fool
theory
that
says
somebody
else
is
always
willing
to
pay
more

G.

effective

That
skepticism
would
leave
him
with
an
even
greater
credibility
problem
should
he
return
that
would
handicap
him
in
any
effort
to
oust
the
board
in
a
proxy
fight
.

Assuming
that
he
paid
a
rough
average
price
of
$
80
a
share
,
and
assuming
he
did
n't
sell
before
his
announcement
reached
the
market
,
Mr.

could
be
sitting
with
a
modest

When
ad
dollars
are
tight
,
the
high
page
cost
is
a
major
deterrent
for
advertisers
,
who
generally
want
to
appear
regularly
in
a
publication
or
not
at
all
.

adds
something
to

Honeywell
said
its
Defense
and
Marine
Systems
group
incurred
delays
in
shipping
some
undisclosed
contracts
during
the
third
quarter
,
resulting
in
lower
operating
profit
for
that
business
.

The
plans
include
a
subway
system
,
a
congress
center
,
floating
trees
,
fanciful
fountains
--
and
as
many
as
60,000
additional
tourists

Although
it
would
be
costly
to
shoot
multiple
versions
,
TV
programmers
could
let

vote

different
endings
for

.

This
statement
surely
buttresses
your
editorial
viewpoint
that
environmental
protection
is
generally
silly
or
excessive
,
but
it
is
simply
wrong
.

Potential
bondholders
will
either
look
for
greater
equity
participation
on

of
management
,
or
insist
the
equity
component
of
the
deals
be
substantially
greater
than
in
the
past

Ad
Notes
...
.

Overall
,
Honeywell
reported
earnings
of
$
74.4
million
,
or
$
1.73
a
share
,
for
the
three
months
ended
Oct.
1
compared
with
a
loss
of
$
41.4
million
,
or
98
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

That
hurts
investors
'
confidence
in
the
economy
and
stocks
.

Since
the
crash
,
many
futures
traders
have
n't
assumed
large
positions
for
fear
that
the
S&P
500
market
,
with
much
of
its
customer
order
flow
missing
,
would
dry
up
if
prices
turned
against
them
.

It
's
1956

the
year

Suez
crisis
marked
the
final
end
of
Empire

``

For

When
Nucor
Corp.
begins
shipping
steel
from
the
world

first
thin-slab

it
will
begin
testing
the
competitive
mettle
of
its
giant
competitors
.

But
right
now
programmers
are
figuring
that
viewers
who
are
busy
dialing
up
a
range
of
services
may
put
down
their
remote
control
zappers
and
stay
tuned
.

Bay
said
a
``
substantial
part
''
of
its
debt
outstanding
is
in
default
as
a
result
of
inability
to
sell
certain
properties
quickly
and
lower-than-expected
prices
for
sales
made
.

The

``
When

fewer

They
either
pick
it
up

The

said
he
also
would
be

that

Dual

gives
an

trader
the
right
to
trade
both
for
his
own
account
and
for
customers

The
cost
of
executing
stock
orders
varies
from
brokerage
to
brokerage
and
with
the
size
of
the
order
,
but
2
%
of
the

's
value
is
an
average

But
in
a
letter
sent
in
August
to
Asia
Development
,
Schroders
said
the
loan
was
terminated
because
the

Late

Black

Mr.
Gurria
's
optimism
contrasts
with
some
bankers
'
views
that
the
deal
may
require
a
lot
of
arm
twisting

the
U.S.
Treasury
in

When
Mr.

in

he
let
it

costly
to
be
considered
by
CenTrust

Right
away
you
notice
the
following
things
about
a
Philip

.

``
This
is
common
with
a
lot
of
large
companies
,
''
says
Mr.
Borner
,
who
worked
for
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
for
23
years
before
choosing
his
current
trade
.

But
British
Air
,
which
was
to
have
supplied
$
750
million
out
of
$
965
million
in
equity
financing
,
apparently
was
n't
involved
in
the
second
proposal
and
could
well
reject
it
even
if
banks
obtain
financing
.

In
fact
,
Aer
Lingus
started
ferrying
Russians
from
Shannon
to
New
York
when
Washington
stripped
Aeroflot
of
its
U.S.
landing
rights
.

An
assassin
in
Colombia
killed
a
federal

on
a
Medellin
street
.

A
Merc
spokesman
said
the
plan
has
n't
made
much
difference
in
liquidity
in
the
pit
.

Whipsawed
financially
and
emotionally
by
Friday
's
heartstopping
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
and
yesterday
's
88-point
rebound
,
they
're
wondering
if
an
individual
has
any
business
being
in
the
market
.

Some
companies
,
including
Heinz
,
even
pay
part
of
the
fee
.

``
Unless
an
individual
has
a
minimum
of
between
$
50,000
and
$
100,000
to
invest
in
stocks
,
he
's
still
better
off
in
mutual
funds
than
in
individual
stocks
,
in
terms
of
getting
enough
attention
from
a
competent
broker
,
''
says
Mr.
Lipper
.

And
why
not
save
the
costs
of
a
thousand
bureaucrats
by
abolishing
Central
Command
and
putting
responsibility
for
Gulf
naval
operations
back
where
it

``
In

Few

think
it
is
worth
their
time
to
slog
through
the
Polaroid
trial
testimony
.

A
35-nation
environmental
conference
opened
in
Sofia

``
Sometimes

coming
out

room

''
explains
Morgan
Banks
,
the
agency

health
specialist
.

Exchange
officials
reasoned
that
they
would
n't
have
been
able
to
make
such
a
rotation
with
the
time
remaining
Friday
afternoon
,
and
with
the
stock-index
futures
on
the
verge
of
closing
for
a
second
and
final
time
,
the
CBOE
reasoned
that
its
best
course
was
to
remain
closed
.

American
Business
Computer
Corp.
said
it
privately
placed
1,035,000
common
shares
at
$
2.50
a

.

``
If
K
mart
ca
n't

its
act

``
This
is
a

for
takeover-stock

one

Then
the
whole
thing
will
start
to
collapse
,
just
as
it
did
in
the
1970s
,
and
the
ghosts
and
banshees
will
be
howling
through
the
place
turning
people

white
.

Frequently
,
clients
express
interest
in
paintings
but
do
n't
end
up
bidding
,
she
adds

we
do

A
federal
appeals
court
struck
down
a
natural-gas
regulation
that
had
prevented
pipeline
companies
from
passing
to
customers
part
of
$
1
billion
in
costs
from
controversial
``
take-or-pay
''
contracts
.

Algeria
plans
to
increase
natural-gas
sales
to

The
court
,
in

,
threw
out
a
deadline
set
by
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
for
settling
old
contract
disputes
over
gas
that
the
pipeline
companies
reserved
but
did
n't
use
.

UAL
's
board
could
reject
the
new
price
as
too
low
,
especially
since
there
are
n't
any
competing
bids
.

Polaroid
claims
it
could
have
manufactured
and
sold
all
the
instant

sold
by
Kodak
if
Kodak
had
n't
entered
the

The
other
two
options
consist
of
swapping

with

providing
fresh

.

Several
reports
as
the
day
progressed
gave
vague
or
conflicting
indications
about
whether
banks
would
sign
up
.

And
some
investors
at
Fidelity
and
elsewhere
even
began
buying
stock
funds
during
the
day
.

Mr.
Trump
,
who
vowed
Wednesday
to
``
go
forward
''
with
the
bid
,
said
he
was
dropping
it
``
in

of

conditions

At

MLX
has
filed
a
registration
statement
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
covering
a
proposed
offering
of
$
120
million
in
long-term
senior
subordinated
notes
and
warrants
.

The
pros
strenuously
advise
individuals
to
stay
away
from
the
latest
investment
fad
.

But
so
far
,
Mr.
Paul
and
his
advisers
are
holding
fast
.

And
then
there
is
his
notion
of
an
Irish-Soviet
charter
airline
to
ferry
Armenians
to
Los
Angeles
via
Shannon
.

They
stopped
short
of
resuming
diplomatic
ties
,
severed
in
1979
.

The
No.

domestic
aluminum
producer
,
Aluminum
Co.
of
America
,
Friday
said
its
earnings
fell
3.2
%
to
$
219
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
.

Last
year
,
the
Irish
airport
authority
,
in
a
joint
venture
with
Aeroflot
,
opened
four
hard-currency
duty-free
shops
at
Moscow
's
Sheremetyevo
Airport
.

``
We
said
:
`
We
've
got
a
product
:
if
you
want
it
,
you
can
buy
it
,
'
''
he
says
,
adding
:
``
Now
we
're
figuring
out
what
people
need
,
and
are
going
back
to
make
it
.

``
Nothing
has
happened
since
we
signed
the
contract
to
undermine
our
conviction
that
Hydro-Quebec
was
the
lowest-cost
,
most
environmentally
acceptable
choice
for
meeting
a
part
of
our
customers

energy
needs
through

So
Mr.

gave
them

,
which
by
the
end
of
the
1990s
will
enable
production
without
coke

and
blast
furnaces
.

It
implies
that
the
British
Empire
was
rooted
in
its
subjects
'
minds
,
manners
and
morals
,
and
argues
,
tacitly
,
that
its
self-destructive
flaws
were
embodied
in
the
defensive
snobbery
,
willful
blindness
,
role-playing
and
especially
the
locutions
of
its
domestic
servants
.

``
A
key
part
of
the
question
is
,
how
soon
does
this
disk-drive
come
and
how
soon
does
production
ramp
up
?

Since
late
1987
,
for
example
,
it
has
put
off
a
rule
dealing
with
deferred
income
taxes
because
of
the
continuing
controversy
over
the
issue
.

Mr.
Calloway
blamed
the
slower
volume
on
rainier
weather
,
a
dearth
of
new
products
in
the
industry
and
--
to
a
much
lesser
extent
--
pricing
.

Unlikely
as
it
may
seem
,
tiny
,
politically
neutral
Ireland
has
penetrated
the
mighty
Soviet
airline
bureaucracy
.

The
issue
exploded
this
year
after
a
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
operation
led
to
charges
of
widespread
trading
abuses
at
the
Chicago
Board
of

To
hear
advertisers
tell
it
,
the
magazine
just
has
n't
kept
up
with
the
times
.

It
also
enables
minimills
finally
to
get
a
toehold
in

flat-rolled

market
--
the
major

,

prized

and
until
now

untouchable

market
.

Mr.
Calloway
also
noted
that
soft-drink
volume
rose
a
hefty
9
%
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
making
the
comparison
more
difficult
.

And
,
with
those
contacts
in
place
,
it
could
be
relatively
simple
to
add
Aer
Lingus
and
GPA
to
the
team
.

He
does
this
in
at
least
three
of
his
solo
pieces

Aer

Companies
with
steady
earnings
growth
could
do
well
,
she
says
,
while
others
with
high
debt
or
poor
earnings
could
see
their
shares
decline
far
more
than
10
%
.

The
company
did
n't
disclose
the
new
estimate
but
said
the
change
was
related
to
Integrated
's
failure
to
sell
its
core
businesses
,
as
well
as
``
other
events
,
''
which
it
did
n't
detail
,
that
occurred
after
its
announcement
last

that
it
was
in
talks
with
the
unidentified
prospective

Mr.

.

Under
the
original
proposal
,
the
maker
of

coatings
and
a

of
information-display

offered
$
400

due

,
10
common

and
$
175

for

says
,
``
We

His
success
is
easy
to
understand
.

n't
you
know
,
now
that
we
are
spending
jillions
of
dollars
,
and
have
built
those
new

wings
,
and
have
positioned
all
these

and

to
fight

,
the
Russians
seem
to
have
lost
interest
in
the
whole
subject
.

But
let
Stevens
continue
in
his
unwitting
comic
manner
(
his
conscious
efforts
at
``
banter
''
always
fail
--
most
comically
)
:
``
This
whole
question
is
very
akin
to
the
question
that
has
caused
much
debate
in
our
profession
over
the
years
:
what
is
a
`
great
'
butler
?
''

It
also
said
the

had
agreed
to
meet
the
company
for
further
talks
tomorrow
.

``

In

,
or
make

at

It

by
a
Rubens
associate

This
avoids
knocking
down

The
point
is
that
any

can
be
used
as
background
music
for
virtually
anything

Further
,
many
institutions
today
holding
troubled
retailers

will
be
reticent
to
consider
additional
retailing

The
highest
patent
damage
award
to
date
was
in
1986
,
when
Smith

Inc.
was
ordered
to
pay
$
205
million
to
Baker
Hughes

for
infringing
on

``
Institutions
that

buy
retail
paper
have
to
be
more
concerned

You
might
call
it
a
leitmotif
or
a
virtuoso
accomplishment
.

Shoppers
,
many
of
whom
operate
small
businesses
,
pay
annual
membership
fees
,
which
provide
an
income
base
for
the
stores
.

``
We
were
able
to
get
advertisers
to
use
their
promotion
budget
for
this
,

they
get
a
chance

do
couponing

noting
that

Bonds
issued
by
Kroger

Duracell
,
Safeway
and
American
Standard
also
showed
big
gains
,
recovering
almost
all
their

from
Friday

Meanwhile
,
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
the
two
lead
lenders
on
the
UAL

met
with
other

yesterday
to
determine
if
they
would
be
willing

finance

buy-out
at
a

``
It
's
no
longer
enough
to
beat
the

down

Nor
does
it

Amcore
Financial

it

Given
such

some

prefer
to
go
about

quietly

A
formal
blessing
of
sorts
was
bestowed
on
this
friendship
in
April
when
Mikhail

with
Irish

,

aircraft
leasing
company

in

,
could
lease
some
of
its
Boeing
jetliners

the
Soviet

Analysts
worry
that
the

leasing

will
last
at

through
the
first
quarter

Another
sticking
point
for
advertisers
was
National

's
tradition
of
lumping
its
ads
together
,
usually
at
the
beginning

,
rather
than
spreading
ads
out

do
.

Once
again
,
your
editorial
page
misstates
the
law
to
conform
to
your
almost
beatific
misperceptions
.

It
came
on
the
heels
of
a
number
of
local
newspaper
articles
suggesting
that
Mr.
Paul
has
benefited
handsomely
from
his
association
with
CenTrust

's
difficult
to
be
that
consistently
wrong

Mr.

Mr.

sell
its
core

And
expenses
,
up
7.9
%
in

have
stayed
stubbornly
high
.

Otherwise
,
if
you
put
all

you

there
were

Mr.

says
the

has
lost
some
powerful
driving
forces
,
namely
earnings
growth

the
``

up

The
common
view
,
says
Abby
Cohen
,
strategist
for
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
,
is
that
there
will
be
``
mild
economic
growth
,
modest

expansion

and
things
are
going
to
be
hunky-dory

No

certainly
no

The

flurry

activity
came
early
in
the
day

SsangYong
,
which

only
about
3

,
will
sell
about
18,000

its

this
year
,
twice
as
many
as
last
year
.

But
Ms.
McCraw
says
the
magazine
is
fighting
back
.

``
The
feeling
among
many
experts
on
the
commercial
side
is
that
the
price
paid
at
the
time
was
excessive
in
any
event
,
''
Mr.
Tunick
says
.

``
Having
to
take
on
less

certainly
be
an
advantage

said
Mr.

``
You
'll
start

Both

In

,
the

he
passed

soon
they
were
talking

But
traders
said
the
junk
bond
market
increasingly
is
separating
into
a
top-tier
group
,
in
which
trades
can
be
executed
easily
,
and
a
larger
group
of
lower-quality
bonds
in
which
liquidity
--
or
the
ability
to
trade
without
too
much
difficulty
--
has
steadily
deteriorated
this
year
.

``
It
was
an
overreaction
to
an
event
{
the
failure
of
a
management
and
union
group
to
get
bank
financing
for
a
takeover
of
UAL
}
that
does
n't
mean
that
much
to
lots
of
stocks
.

``
It
was
an
extraordinary
situation
that
needed
extraordinary
steps
,
''
said
Paul
Stevens
,
OCC
president
and
chief
operating
officer
.

At
Scudder
and
at
the
smaller
Ivy
funds
group
in
Hingham
,

,
for
instance
,
some
shareholders
called
early
in
the
morning
to
switch
money
from
stock
funds
to
money
market
funds
,
but
later
called
back
to
reverse
the
switches
.

In
the
end
,
after
meeting
with
the
former
housekeeper
,
Stevens
sits
by

seashore
at
dusk
,
thinking
of

and
of

and
declares
``
