#recurrent-net-version-1.1
=====================

Simplest bi-directional recurrent neural network (C++ / OpenCV).

To run this code, you should have 
* OpenCV.

##Compile & Run
* Compile by running:
```
cmake .
make
```
* Run: 
```
./rnn
```
##Structure and Algorithm
See [my tech-blog](http://eric-yuan.me/rnn1/).

##TODO
New post for bi-directional rnn...

##Config Files

####General Parameters Config
* gradient checking (automatically disable dropout, and use tiny dataset)
* store parameters into log file (for debugging, should be faster if not using it)
* batch size
* non-linearity method (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU)
* training epochs
* iteration per epoch
* learning rate
* ngram
* training percent (for cross validation)

####Layers Config
* layer type
* amount of hidden neurons
* dropout rate
* weight decay
* amount of output classes (in **Softmax** Layer, initialized to be 0, because it depends on dataset)

####Multi-Layer
This network supports multiple hidden layers.
